# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose was to develop a list of travel destinations by finding cities near 2,000 random lat/lng points. From those cities, an input for maximum temperature between 60* and 90* was entered to find desirable vacation spots. Of those vacation, nearby hotels were identified. Cities that did not have nearby hotel were reomoved. A travel itinerary was created between four hotels with cities that shared the same country.
